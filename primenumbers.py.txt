'''The common construct is to run a loop and search for an item. If the item is found, 
we break out of the loop using the break statement. There are two scenarios in which the loop may end. 
The first one is when the item is found and break is encountered. The second scenario is that the loop ends without 
encountering a break statement. Now we may want to know which one of these is the reason for a loopâ€™s completion.
 One method is to set a flag and then check it once the loop ends. Another is to use the else clause.'''
